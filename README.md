# Bus-Tracker
In this excercise data and functionality are extracted from Mapbox and used to visually show the location of a bus move between the MIT campus and the Harard campus.This program originated from the MIT X-pro MERN full stack development program.

<h4>To Run this Program</h4>
In order to run this file, open the index.html file in a browser. Then click the button at the top left-hand side to see the marker for the bus move from its starting location at MIT to Harvard. Each click move it stop-by-stop to the end destination.

<h4>Future RoadMap</h4>
This program can be further adapted to use maps of any areas and track the actual buses real-time as they move. The icons and map itself can be visually modified. Other areas of interest can also be added; such as restaurants, etc... by adding the location data onto the grid.
